# Problem 1234: Example Question

## Description
Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, determine if they are almost equal. Two strings are considered almost equal if you can swap at most one pair of characters in one of the strings to make them equal.

## Example
Input: `s1 = "bank", s2 = "kanb"`  
Output: `true`

Input: `s1 = "attack", s2 = "defend"`  
Output: `false`

## Constraints
- The strings have the same length.
